# Data-Visualization-with-Tableau-

In this project, I have created a series of interactive Tableau dashboards analyzing the Amazon Bestsellers (2009–2019) dataset, which contains details of top-selling books over a decade, including book title, author, user rating (out of 5), number of reviews, price, year, and genre (Fiction/Non-Fiction).
Leveraged Tableau to uncover insights on author performance, reader engagement, pricing patterns, and genre popularity. Applied aggregation functions, bar and column charts, and data storytelling techniques to present findings in an accessible format. Published all dashboards on Tableau Public for public viewing and portfolio demonstration.

3. Book Prices per Author

Compares cumulative or average book prices across authors from the Amazon Bestsellers dataset, helping identify premium vs. budget publishing strategies.
